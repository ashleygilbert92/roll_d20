# Pathfinder RPG Tool using Python Flask
## https://roll-d20.com/


## Part1:

a)	Title: Pathfinder RPG Tool using Python Flask

b)	What will it do: Keep track of dice roll probability and data for play session 
(damage taken, damage done, healing, EXP earned, etc), calculate EXP, log session notes, 
form for player feedback, and have separate profiles for Dungeon Maters/campaigns, Grid 
overlay for maps, new product notifications.

c)	Target Audience: People who play Pathfinder RPG

d)	Data: Player feedback, play session data, dice rolls, and notes.

e)	Technologies: Python, Python Flask, Bootstrap, MySQL, Jinja

f)	Stretch Goals: Pictures for campaign page, player description page for other players, campaign specific rules page

## Part 2:

a)	Website: Will likely host it on Heroku or AWS. Both have lots of resources for flask apps.



## Project Checkpoints:

October 4th - Server, domain, basic flask app with file structure, mysql database setup with expected tables, create basic template for expected pages

October 23rd - Login page and session handling, routes defined, dice roll page, player feedback page, forms for play session page 

November 8th - Play session page previous session/encounter view, session notes page and view, grid map page setup, DM dashboard

November 27th - Figure out grid map overlay and display/download, figure out how to pull data for notifications, EXP calculation page 


## Checkpoint 1:
Oct 4th: I created my server, domain, basic flask app, mysql database with tables setup, and created templates (currently don't have any content). https://roll-d20.com/


## Checkpoint 2:
Oct 23rd: I have created a login page with session handling across the website (username: ashleymia92@gmail.com 
passwoord: P@ssword1), I've created the dice roll/probability page, I've created the player feedback page for non 
logged in users and logged in users. I still need to create the forms for the play session page and have those 
figured out. Will work on this more and have these tasks finished by the end of the week.
